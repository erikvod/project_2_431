# Competition for Dylan

## 1. Lisp Family (e.g., Common Lisp, Scheme)
**Overlap:**
- Dylan’s syntax and features were inspired by Lisp, but it aimed to move beyond the heavy reliance on parentheses and offer a more approachable syntax for developers.

**Advantages of Lisp:**
- Highly mature ecosystem with extensive libraries and tools.
- Strong support in the academic and AI research communities.

**Dylan's Competitive Edge:**
- Object-oriented features integrated directly into the language.
- A more modern and readable syntax compared to Lisp’s fully parenthesized style.

## 2. Smalltalk
**Overlap:**
- Both Smalltalk and Dylan are object-oriented and emphasize dynamic programming capabilities.

**Advantages of Smalltalk:**
- A complete and integrated environment for object-oriented programming.
- Widely adopted for teaching and prototyping in the 1980s and early 1990s.

**Dylan's Competitive Edge:**
- Combined object-oriented and functional paradigms.
- Better performance through optional static optimizations.

## 3. C++
**Overlap:**
- Both C++ and Dylan were seen as candidates for large-scale commercial software development.

**Advantages of C++:**
- High performance due to static compilation.
- Extensive adoption in industry and support for low-level system programming.

**Dylan's Competitive Edge:**
- Simpler syntax and reduced verbosity.
- Dynamic features and garbage collection, which were lacking in C++ at the time.

## 4. Java (Mid-1990s)
**Overlap:**
- Java emerged as a general-purpose language for cross-platform development, similar to Dylan’s initial goals.

**Advantages of Java:**
- Platform independence with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- Strong corporate backing by Sun Microsystems.

**Dylan's Competitive Edge:**
- More advanced support for functional programming and multiple inheritance.

## 5. Python and Ruby (Emerging in the 1990s)
**Overlap:**
- Like Dylan, these languages emphasized simplicity, readability, and rapid development.

**Advantages of Python and Ruby:**
- Simpler and more intuitive syntax for new programmers.
- Quickly built strong communities and extensive standard libraries.

**Dylan's Competitive Edge:**
- More robust type system and macro capabilities.

## Why Dylan Struggled Against Its Competition

**Tooling and Ecosystem:**
- Dylan lacked robust compilers, IDEs, and libraries, while competitors like C++ and Java benefited from significant industrial investment.

**Adoption and Marketing:**
- Other languages, particularly Java, were heavily marketed and supported by large corporations, overshadowing Dylan.

**Timing:**
- Dylan was introduced during a transitional period in computing when other languages were becoming dominant (e.g., Java for enterprise, Python for general-purpose scripting).

**Focus Shift at Apple:**
- Apple’s changing priorities, particularly after the Newton PDA project, reduced its internal support for Dylan.
