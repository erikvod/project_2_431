DYLAN: Short for <ins>DY</ins>namic <ins>LAN</ins>guage

This programming language was developed in the early 90s by a team at Apple with the goal of a powerful, flexible language suitable for commercial software, combining the strengths of dynamic and static languages, and leveraging the best features of functional and object-oriented paradigms, with the aim to support rapid prototyping and efficient develoopment of applications for platforms with diverse hardware capabilities - like the Apple Newton PDA.

Dylan was developed out of the need to create a language that met the exact needs of the developers. It was born out of frustrations with Smalltalk, LISP, and C++

Specifically to:

- Simplify the development of dynamic and adaptive software systems.
- Provide a dynamic object-oriented environment that is as efficient as static languages.
- Reduce the complexity and verbosity of traditional object-oriented programming while preserving its power.
- Create a developer-friendly syntax that is easier to read and write than the fully-parenthesized style of Lisp-derived languages.

Key Characteristics:
paradigms, typing disciplines, key features

Impact and Legacy:

Although Dymlan was initially envisioned to be used for development of applications on platforms like the Newton, its lack of widespread can be attributed to limited availability of robust compilers, IDEs, and libraries. The language was open-sourced in 2002, and and is supported through open-source implementations such as Open Dylan and Gwydoion Dylan, maintained by the community.
