# Shortcomings and Future Plans of the Dylan Programming Language

## Shortcomings

### 1. Limited Adoption

- **Niche Usage**: Dylan has not achieved widespread adoption and remains a niche language within the programming community.

### 2. Tooling and Ecosystem Limitations

- **Development Tools**: The language lacks modern integrated development environments (IDEs) and debugging tools, which hinders developer productivity.
- **Library Support**: A limited selection of libraries and frameworks restricts its applicability in various domains.

### 3. Learning Curve

- **Complex Syntax**: Dylan's combination of functional and object-oriented paradigms, along with its unique syntax, presents a steep learning curve for new developers.

### 4. Documentation Challenges

- **Sparse Resources**: Comprehensive and up-to-date documentation is lacking, making it difficult for developers to learn and effectively use the language.

### 5. Community Support

- **Small Community**: The limited user base results in fewer community-driven resources, such as tutorials, forums, and third-party tools.

## Future Plans
(Mostly speculative)
### 1. Community Engagement:

**Open-Source Contributions**: Encouraging community members to contribute to the language's development, documentation, and ecosystem can help address existing limitations.

### 2. Tooling Enhancements

**Modern Development Tools**: Plans include developing and integrating modern IDE support, debugging tools, and build systems to improve the developer experience.

### 3. Language Modernization

**Feature Updates**: Updating the language to include modern programming features and paradigms to align with current development practices.

### 4. Documentation Improvement

**Resource Development**: Creating comprehensive, accessible, and up-to-date documentation to assist both new and experienced developers.

### 5. Ecosystem Expansion

**Library Development**: Encouraging the creation and maintenance of libraries and frameworks to broaden Dylan's applicability across various domains.
