### Who Used Dylan, When, and For What

#### **Who Used Dylan?**
1. **Apple Inc.**  
   - The primary developers and early users of Dylan.  
   - Focused on building it as a versatile programming language for their internal projects and products.  

2. **Open Source Community**  
   - After Dylan was open-sourced in 2002, its use was taken up by a niche group of developers who maintained and expanded upon the language through projects like **Open Dylan** and **Gwydion Dylan**.  

#### **When Was Dylan Used?**
- **Early 1990s:** Initial development and testing by Apple for commercial software development, particularly for devices like the Newton PDA.  
- **1995:** Official attempts to introduce Dylan for broader commercial use.  
- **2002 and beyond:** Open-sourced, enabling the community to experiment with and sustain the language.  

#### **For What Purposes Was Dylan Used?**
1. **Apple's Newton PDA Development**  
   - Dylan was envisioned as a primary programming language for developing applications on the Apple Newton PDA. The goal was to have a dynamic and efficient language to handle the platform's constraints.  
   - However, this vision was not fully realized due to delays and changes in Apple's strategy.  

2. **Rapid Prototyping**  
   - Dylan was designed to allow for rapid prototyping of software applications, blending dynamic and static paradigms to enable flexibility during the development process.  

3. **Dynamic and Adaptive Systems**  
   - It was particularly suited for creating dynamic, object-oriented systems that could adapt at runtime.  

4. **Educational and Experimental Use (Post-2002)**  
   - After being open-sourced, Dylan gained a following among programming language enthusiasts and academics. It became a platform for exploring advanced programming concepts, such as dynamic dispatch, multiple inheritance, and macro systems.
