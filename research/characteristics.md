- methods can accept variable number of parameters and/or parameters ofvariable types.
- multiple inheritance is allowed.
- getters and setters are with predefined names automatically generated.
- exception handling is provided. In case something happens, a program can signal a condition. Handlers describe how various conditions should be processed.
